# Apple Pockets ("Apfeltaschen")

Very easy to make with minimal ingredients.

## Ingredients

- around 300g puff pastry ("Bl√§tterteig")
- 1 - 2 medium sized apples
- sugar (optional)
- cinnamon powder (optional, "Zimt")
- powdered sugar (optional)

### Tools

- Oven
- Baking sheet(s) & Baking sheet paper
- Fork (optional, for pattern)
- Knife

## Estimated time

This estimation assumes you have store bought puff pastry.

- Preparation: 5 min
- Bakeing: 15 - 20 min

## Directions

1. Turn oven to the temperature mentioned on the puff pastry's packaging (probably around 200 degrees celsius)
2. Cut the apple(s) into small cubes. I'd go with roughly 0.5cm length each side.
    There is no need to peel the apple beforehand.
3. Put the puff pastry on a baking sheet covered with baking sheet paper.
    Cut it into an even number of equally sized rectangles.
4. Put the cut apples on half of the rectangles.
    Tip: If you thing of the peices as a checc board and cover only one color you have automatically spaced the pockets and do not need to rearange them later.
5. Optional: If you have cinnamon and sugar, mix them together and put a bit of it ontop of the apples.
6. Cover each of the apple pieces with one of the empty pieces.
    Combine the edges by pressing down on them. If you have a fork, use it to create a nice pattern.
7. Put the sheet in the oven.
    Again, follow the instructions of the puff pastry's packaging (usually 15 - 20 minutes).
8. Optional: After you take them out of the oven, cover the apple pockets with powdered sugar.
