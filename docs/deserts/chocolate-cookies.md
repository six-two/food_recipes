# Chocolate Cookies

Very simple cookies.
Kneading the dough takes a lot of work through, it took much longer than the other cookie recipes.

## Ingredients

- 350g flour
- 250g butter
- 150g cane sugar ("Rohrzucker")
- 50g baking cocoa
- Optional: ehocolate

The ingredients resulted in 1 tightly packed baking sheet of cookies.
You may want to scale down the ingredients a bit to make sure that the cookies will fit.
Should be easy, since each weight is a multiple of 50g.
