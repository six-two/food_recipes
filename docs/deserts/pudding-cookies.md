Very sweet cookies.

## Ingredients

- 200g flour
- 200g butter
- 80g powdered sugar (+some extra for covering, optional)
- 1 bag vanilla pudding powder (37g)
- 1 bag vanilla sugar (8g, optional)

### Tools

- Oven
- Baking sheet(s) & Baking sheet paper
- Scale
- Fork (optional, for pattern)
- Sieve (only for powdered sugar)

- Bake cookies: 15 min

## Directions

1. Mix everything except the butter in a bowl
2. Add butter in small slices
3. Knead by hand until a smooth dough forms
4. Put dough in the fridge for 45 - 60 min
5. Preheat oven to 160 degree celsius (circulating air)
6. Cover a baking sheet with baking sheet paper
7. Cut dough into around 40 similarly sized pieces
8. Roll each piece into a ball, put it on the sheet and press down on it with a fork, to make a wavy surface.
    Keep at lease 2cm distance between the cookies, since they will expand when baking

## Notes

- Original recipe (german): [Puddingpl√§tzchen by Siggi](https://www.einfachbacken.de/rezepte/puddingplaetzchen-dein-neues-lieblings-rezept)
    - They were very sweet, so I slightly increased the flour and butter in relation to the rest of the ingredients
