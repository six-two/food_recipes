# Beer pancakes

## Ingredients

The following creates a bit more than a meal for me.
So using around 80% of it should be sufficient for me in the future.

- 250ml milk
- 120g flour
- 2 eggs
- 60ml beer (or other fizzy beverage)
- 30g sugar
- oil for cooking
- salt (optional)

### Tools

- pan
- bowl
- spatula
- whisk (or a spoon / fork)

## Estimated time

- Prepare dough: 5 min
- Cooking time: 25 min

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Add milk and eggs and mix ingredients.
3. Add the beer last (since mixing it too much will remove the air bubbles) and mix it in too.
4. Let the dough rest for a couple minutes.
    During this time you can heat up a pan with oil.
5. Once the pan is hot, add in a little bit of the pancake batter to make a tiny pancake (like 4cm diameter).
    This will let you check the temperature without ruining a whole pancake if it is off.
6. For each pancake add a bit of oil into the pan, then some batter to fill most of the pan.
    You can usually turn them over when the edges of the pancake stop sticking to the pan.

## Notes

- Original recipe generated with <https://phind.com> using the queries:

    > give me a recipe to make pancakes using only flour, eggs, milk, sugar, water, slat, and/or beer

    > use metric units like grams or ml instead of cups and spoons

- Any other fizzy beverage (Sprite, Fanta, ginger beer, or even sparkling water) instead of beer should work too.
    I used Radler (half beer, half lemonade) since it gives more sweetness and I like to drink it.
    The purpose is making the pancakes more fluffy without having to use baking soda.
