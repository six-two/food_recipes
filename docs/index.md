# Recipes

This is a collection of recipes I have encountered and liked.
Usually they are simple to make (requiring few unusual ingredients and mostly common kitchen utensils).

Probably contains a bunch of (spelling) errors, since they are often based on german recipes and my english is not that great, when it comes to cooking vocabilary.
